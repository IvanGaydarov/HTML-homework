				<p>Hi everybody! My name is Ivan Gaydarov. I am 24 years old and I am Aquarius. I graduated
				the Technical University of Sofia with bachelor degree in "Telecommunications".
				 And now I'm graduating the Master degree in the same speciazation. </p>
				 <p>I started the course IT Talents because I changed mi point of view. It's interesting and I look at the course as a challenge to me, which I want to complete successfully. I've met new people who are smart and it's nice to communicate with them, because you will learn new things every time.</p>
				<p>I like being in the wild... walking in the forest or near the river no matter what the wheather is. Being in places like these I fell calm and humble. The nature can charge you up with energy. I like some sports, most of all football and athletics. I workout in my free time, it makes me fell good.</p>
